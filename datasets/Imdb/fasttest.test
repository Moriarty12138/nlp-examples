__label__0 combine the bad writing and bad acting this movie just totally fail .
__label__0 there is no humor , no humanity , no people one can recognize .
__label__0 every cliche in the book is used , and the low budget assures terrible special effects .
__label__0 in this case , jcvd is the talent and the only reason anyone is watching this film .
__label__0 this cinematic failure is littered with cheesy , cliche dialogue that 's worse than angsty teen poetry .
__label__0 but , since this movie deserves nothing good said of it , i 'll use the term god-awful instead .
__label__0 the cinematography looks nice , but that 's not enough to save this tripe .
__label__0 it 's a five minute skit dragged on for a whole movie .
__label__0 lacking not only in plot , but the acting is atrocious .
__label__0 not because the film was funny , but because the film was so very bad .
__label__0 thirdly , the acting left mind-blowing amounts to be desired - it was appalling , it really was .
__label__0 some competent acting talent was squandered .
__label__0 after about 30 minutes i stopped the movie , went on-line to see how many minutes this disaster was .
__label__0 there are actually a handful of great lines of dialogue but for the most part its awkward and weak .
__label__0 this , my friends , is one of the worst tv movies i 've ever seen .
__label__0 what was even more stupid was the very lame dance sequence with travolta and uma thurman .
__label__0 i even like a lot of things many would consider revolting but this is just moronic .
__label__0 if you wish to have a truly traumatic experience , than this awful motion picture is for you .
__label__0 a mostly uninteresting and forgettable , but not awful , and sometimes entertaining , rendition of the tale .
__label__0 3/10 for the good acting .
__label__0 if you remember them in the 40s and than watch this , you 'll probably become extremely depressed .
__label__0 the staging , color coordination and whatever else went into making this movie was alienating at best .
__label__0 terribly scripted dialogue delivered by brain-dead actors , a ridiculous plot and a predictable twist .
__label__0 i give this nonsense a 2 instead of a 1 because there is a worse show called haunted homes .
__label__0 the plot just creeps along , not giving us a lot of suspense .
__label__0 chevy chase is dull and amazingly unfunny .
__label__0 the competition for the worst warner bros kay francis movie is stiff .
__label__0 from the poorly done animation , to the beyond bad acting .
__label__0 hardware wars is the only good spoof on star wars , other films like spaceballs have failed .
__label__0 my final comment is : do not waste your time and money to watch this uninspired and boring film .
__label__0 i always wonder why celebrities would appear in such bad movies .
__label__0 this one is definitely one for my `` worst movies ever '' list .
__label__0 this really is the worst film i have ever seen .
__label__0 although it is only an hour and a half long it feels somewhere close to 4 .
__label__0 i rate it 1/10 , simply because there is no lower rating to give .
__label__0 all in all , i pretty much hated this movie , and could not wait for it to end .
__label__0 it was tedious , boring and , amazingly , full of bad language , unlike its predecessor movies .
__label__0 the plot is clumsy and has holes in it .
__label__0 mistake 1 : absolutely no connection to any of the characters .
__label__0 i found this movie puerile and silly , as well as predictable .
__label__0 do n't waste your money , your time , or your good judgement .
__label__0 his dreams are very corny and make no sense at all , and is very poorly done .
__label__0 all in all , very disappointed in something i 've waited for years to watch .
__label__0 a low rent affair with no name actors and laughable effects , not recommended for any reason .
__label__0 acting , direction , editing appalling , dialog & plot little better .
__label__0 one of the worst films ever made by a male director about woman .
__label__0 also , the gore is not that abundant and when it happens it 's truly bad .
__label__0 bad cgi , bad screenplay , bad story , bad acting , bad dialog , bad characterisation .
__label__0 all in all , madman is pretty much terrible and dull .
__label__0 i can only say : thanks for wasting at least an hour of my life .
__label__0 first off , the mistakes that they made with the movie .
__label__0 i did n't make it to the end so i will give this a 3 .
__label__0 in fact , it 's amazing that a norma shearer and clark gable film could be this dull !
__label__0 to sum it up , words really can not describe just how bad this movie is .
__label__0 the rest of the characters are , well , uninspired , and purely the invention of the screenwriters .
__label__0 this movie is the worst movie i have ever seen .
__label__0 it was wooden , totally unrealistic and had no plot or meaning to the story .
__label__0 honestly , it must be one of the worst movies i 've ever seen .
__label__0 surprisingly i had the misfortune of sitting through this turkey before mystery science theater 3000 tore it to pieces .
__label__0 i left two friends pinned in by a great fat bloke to endure the remainder .
__label__0 there is one and one reason alone to see this dull , uneventful horror flick : billy drago .
__label__0 this is probably the worst adaptation i 've ever seen .
__label__0 this was not that type of pause -- it was just simply bad directing .
__label__0 this movie was so flipping bad , it made `` hulk '' look like `` the departed '' .
__label__0 not even to make fun of it or see how bad it really is .
__label__0 i 've seen some crappy movies in my life , but this one must be among the very worst .
__label__0 never have i seen a movie that is so dull , poorly acted , and incoherent .
__label__0 staring the biggest -- most talentless -- show offs that ever went before the camera .
__label__0 this anime greatly disappointed me because it removed the comedy and high quality action of the manga and ova .
__label__0 that 's not necessarily bad in itself , but there 's nothing to make up for the barren settings .
__label__0 i only give it a 2 , because of lana 's presence in it .
__label__0 but his performance in this case is plain stupid , both with respect the lines uttered and the acting .
__label__0 trying to build too much with very little , this film and its evil predictable villain is just lame .
__label__0 this was one of the worst films i have ever seen .
__label__0 i have a fetish for truly bad cinema and this is one of my faves .
__label__0 avoid this film at all costs !
__label__0 ending : final ending making no sense .
__label__0 this was truly the worst movie i have ever seen .
__label__0 not scary , suspenseful or even funny .
__label__0 i found michael to be pompous , arrogant , and just plain clueless .
__label__0 oh , i forgot , there was one redeeming feature - the scenery was nice .
__label__0 how did they get the great orson welles to narrate this train wreck ?
__label__0 one of the worst romantic comedies i 've ever seen .
__label__0 do n't lose an hour and a half of your life on unmemorable crap .
__label__0 the story was contrived and uninteresting .
__label__0 the script seemed to be a string of bad and crude gags separated by a lot of talking .
__label__0 this is the worst movie i have ever seen .
__label__0 this honestly is the worst show i have ever seen on tv .
__label__0 so much potential , yet so painful to sit through .
__label__0 this is a truly horrible , incomprehensible mess of a film .
__label__0 : ) anyway , my vote was 3 for this flick , because it was bad .
__label__0 like italian automobiles , the film is stylish but the mechanics are crappy and very distracting .
__label__0 it is one of the least thrilling thrillers i have ever come across .
__label__0 do not waste your time or your money on this movie .
__label__0 this was not funny and a complete disappointment and focused on sex and made fun of religion .
__label__0 do n't expect this to be a great movie or take things seriously then u 'll be thoroughly disappointed .
__label__0 overall , bad script , bad lighting , bad portrayals , bad props , even .
__label__0 it was without a doubt the worst movie that i 've seen in a long time .
__label__0 looking back on it all , the gangsta ' macbeth holds one positive : plenty of action .
__label__0 what an awful , messy and bloody script , the story lines are the most horrible thing ever .
__label__0 it 's possible to make a good film like that , but this was amateur hour .
__label__0 i like chris rock , but i feel he is wasted in this film .
__label__0 i realize that i 'm merely scratching the surface , but i 've wasted enough time on this movie .
__label__0 poorly written , this film has the thinnest and most ridiculous `` plot '' i 've ever seen .
__label__0 `` another 48 hours '' is a waste of time , talent and space .
__label__0 this is one of the most awful history movies in the nearest past .
__label__0 the invention gags by carrot top are some of the most awful attempts to be funny in recorded history .
__label__0 the plot is also terrible and is kind of a mix between alice in wonderland and mad max .
__label__0 honestly , this is one of the worst horror movies i 've seen in quite a while .
__label__0 this is quite possibly the worst show i have ever seen in a long time .
__label__0 can be a good thing , but in this case , it just does n't work .
__label__0 this movie had terrible acting , terrible plot , and terrible choice of actors .
__label__0 ben affleck is back to making the same boring , bad acting films .
__label__0 yes there were times where the jokes were funny , but the stereotypical roles were painful .
__label__0 'the death of batman ' is disturbing without being rewarding in the slightest .
__label__0 i left two friends pinned in by a great fat bloke to endure the remainder .
__label__0 there are some nice visual touches that justifiably lend this movie historical importance but watching it is a misery .
__label__0 intended to be dreamlike and impressionistic , the soul bared , it is , instead , morose mush .
__label__0 bad special effects with bad everything else make this more of a snooze-fest than a good horror .
__label__0 it just does n't work at any level and is just a giant bore .
__label__0 i ca n't imagine how hard the scriptwriter of memento will laugh by looking this failure .
__label__0 i was so bored with this movie that i actually fast-forwarded thru the ending to get it over with .
__label__0 there 's b-movie ingenuity at work here in this silly time-waster .
__label__0 adele , who is solidly portrayed by susan sarandon , did not come off as a very likable character .
__label__0 revolver 's a waste of everyone 's time .
__label__0 the effects are very bad , even though there is some gore , and the story is stupid .
__label__0 this piece of trash was an insult to highlander fans .
__label__0 the hands down worst movie i have ever had the misfortune of watching .
__label__0 it was not scary or funny , it was boring .
__label__0 i finished with the feeling that i had watched pointless propaganda -- both sides were unconvincing .
__label__0 art of the devil 2 tries to insert some quality into this horror genre but it mostly falls flat .
__label__0 this is just a very bad , predictable and clichéd film by that hack director andrew v mclaglen .
__label__0 this is the worst cgi muck i 've seen since the hulk !
__label__0 just simply painful to sit through , i turned it off before it was over .
__label__0 the plots are very trite and predictable .
__label__0 having seen the first 2 episodes of kingdom hospital , i must say that i am already really disappointed .
__label__0 it really is hard to determine how bad the acting is when you have dubbing this abysmal .
__label__0 the film 's too short but not if you 're actually watching it ... 3/10
__label__0 sorry to pop your bubble , folks , but the whole movie is pointless .
__label__0 i will not watch this film again , once is enough .
__label__0 chris klein 's character was unlikable from the start and never made an improvement .
__label__0 dexter does n't get up to laugh nor does he show any kind of laughter .
__label__0 director gyllenhaal fails to generate compassion for any of the characters involved , not even isaiah !
__label__0 songs and music is very mediocre and does not support narration .
__label__0 the first song , in the boardroom , is mildly funny but badly sung .
__label__0 the only good thing about the movie is the little girl emily , brilliantly played by eliza bennett .
__label__0 but being a cheap made-for-tv affair this has to be the worst , although boasts an impressive cast .
__label__0 do not waste your time ! !
__label__0 it 's very gory , a lot of nudity , do n't waste your time .
__label__0 the whole storyline is absurd and complicated , with very little resolution .
__label__0 bad script , no budget = no action , bad acting all around .
__label__0 the film has no storyline , no good actor , no horrifying atmosphere or even a decent screenplay .
__label__0 this is some of the worst acting i have ever seen .
__label__0 fans of the traditional 1980s b-movie slashers should take steps to avoid this movie .
__label__0 while it probably tries to be serious it just comes off as silly .
__label__0 it was wrought with clichés and very unfunny jokes and set ups .
__label__0 this movie was very disappointing , and except for a few moments , was n't fly at all .
__label__0 i do n't think i 've ever seen a movie this bad in my life , honestly .
__label__0 this movie is a very poor attempt to make money using a classical theme .
__label__0 this is no budget film-making at its very , very worst .
__label__0 the movie is boring , the characters and scenarios are unrealistic , unbelievable , the action is hilarious .
__label__0 all in all , 2/10 .
__label__0 i refuse to even say anymore about this trash , i dare not give it anymore attention than this .
__label__0 this film commits the fatal error of making the viewer not care what happens to characters .
__label__0 so please if you have the choice , watch the grinch instead of this mess .
__label__0 so trust me and stay away from this waste of celluloid .
__label__0 however this argument is not sufficient for me to rate it more than 1 star .
__label__0 much too old to do action stunts most of his martial arts scenes are unconvincing stunt doubles .
__label__0 the first 7 or 8 years were brilliant , but things dropped off after that .
__label__0 the writer and director should be ashamed they spent the money this type trash .
__label__0 there 's a bit of creepiness to the proceedings but mostly it 's just plain dull .
__label__0 the story just jumps from a to b to c without any logical steps in between .
__label__0 do yourself a favour and skip this dud .
__label__0 there are some cool death scenes early on , but then the pace seems to plod for ages .
__label__0 just one of the most terrible films i have ever seen .
__label__0 i can not think of one positive thing to say about this movie , not one .
__label__0 started out interesting but then the story got more and more ridiculous .
__label__0 like i said above , there were some creepy scenes , but otherwise , this movie was a mess .
__label__0 the bad : average story , a formula weeper , underdeveloped `` romance '' , not enough artie lange .
__label__0 it does n't move anywhere , the characters are just totally bizarre , the underlying plot equally so .
__label__0 the film has little plot , the feel of a documentary , and most of the scenes are perfunctory .
__label__0 terrible movie with a surf `` theme '' that had nothing to do with surfing and no real surfers .
__label__0 in fact , everything after the apartment is not only unfunny ; it 's actually downright boring .
__label__0 the worst movie ever , even howard the duck was a masterpiece compared to this tax shelter .
__label__0 this film is so dreadful , it should have a public health warning .
__label__0 sorry , duke , but this gets a 1 .
__label__0 the dialog is excruciating , and the bleakness of their lives is not original enough to get past it .
__label__0 the plot is weak , ripped scene for scene from classy hong kong action movies .
__label__0 i would never want to watch this again .
__label__0 along three quarters of the movie , catherine just seems to be mentally retarded , poor thing .
__label__0 when we left , pretty much everyone was talking about what a waste of time this film was .
__label__0 i do not write many reviews here , but felt this movie was so awful that it deserved comment .
__label__0 this movie simply does n't succeed -- not as an adaptation , not on its own terms .
__label__0 really one of the worst films in recent memory .
__label__0 reign in darkness is not just horrid , it 's really bad !
__label__0 i gave this movie 2 instead of 1 just just because i am a polite person .
__label__0 do n't waste your time .
__label__0 the script is horrible -- full of unlikable characters and has an extremely mean-spirited tone to it .
__label__0 pretty much the only thing original about vampire wars is about how bad it is .
__label__0 i 'd give it 1 , but the soundtrack is ok , so 2/10 .
__label__0 it 's not funny , it 's not scary , it 's just horrible .
__label__0 the acting is even more wooden than the trees in the wood .
__label__0 avoid it at all costs .
__label__0 the acting is really cheesy in some parts , and the `` action '' scenes are completely laughable .
__label__0 violent without remorse ; predictable without restraint ; terrible beyond belief .
__label__0 the humor completely failed when it was attempted as the affect of the actors was so flat .
__label__0 it 's nothing like the book , which is much better than this turkey of a movie .
__label__0 i would tell you more but i did n't want to waste my life watching this dreck .
__label__0 what you can expect from this : bad acting , cheap effects , and a story that goes nowhere .
__label__0 imagine my shock and disappointment when i found out that pat and jack were not in this sequal .
__label__0 i considered giving this pitiful , soporific comedy a 1 , but settled on a 2 for some reason .
__label__0 yes there were times where the jokes were funny , but the stereotypical roles were painful .
__label__0 there is very little consistency of style in this mess as well .
__label__0 no redeeming features at all .
__label__0 to director michael cooney thanks for wasting my time .
__label__0 go watch some other movie instead , there are hundreds , even thousands better action movies .
__label__0 all in all a poorly done detective flick .
__label__0 the writing is terrible and unoriginal , and the dialogue is worsened with these actors .
__label__0 pathetic main actors ; even ridiculous supporting cast .
__label__0 poor writing and really , truly no sense of character development .
__label__0 it 's an interesting idea but the film itself is boring , dull and somewhat poorly made .
__label__0 this is one of the worst movies i 've ever seen .
__label__0 i found this to be a very flat movie , little in the way of excitement or scares .
__label__0 stop the real racists and do n't see this movie .
__label__0 second , not a damn thing is ever explained regarding the scarecrows and paranormal occurrences .
__label__0 the car chase is n't so bad but the car racing at the end is exceptionally boring .
__label__0 usually the twist at the end makes the episode great -- this one killed it !
__label__0 all along the movie , the behavior of the policeman bullitt is highly unprofessional .
__label__0 a paper thin plot and a few shots of mrs. derek in no clothes .
__label__0 second , the ending , such as it was , did n't seem to resolve or accomplish anything .
__label__0 the film is completely disjointed , each scene seems to confuse the story further rather than carry it forward .
__label__0 avoid at all costs .
__label__0 this is possibly one of the worst giant killer animal movies i have ever seen .
__label__0 i must say that i was truly disappointed , not because of the music but the movie in itself .
__label__0 i feel sorry for whoever has the misfortune to get roped into seeing this : cliched and dull .
__label__0 the plot was convoluted to the point of not being able to follow what was going on .
__label__0 nothing really exciting happens and the few action scenes seem to have been shot by someone in a trance .
__label__0 you simply do n't care about the plot , the actors but you will hate the awful muzak .
__label__0 the only reason i gave it a 3 was because the graphics were semi charming .
__label__0 i hate to criticize a film made in 1943 , but this is really a big disappointment .
__label__0 to call this entire movie hack film making would be an insult to hack film makers everywhere .
__label__0 worse than the worst that ever came out of the worst that ever came out of former snl players .
__label__0 this film has absolutely nothing to do with the first one , its a different reality entirely .
__label__0 this is so overly clichéd you 'll want to switch it off after the first 45 minutes .
__label__0 it really is the `` worst movie ever made ! ''
__label__0 music , yes , bad ... who could n't even hear some parts it was stupid .
__label__0 it 's pure ineptness from start to finish and some of the most ridiculous scenes in movie history .
__label__0 a total failure of following hk 's shaolin soccer .
__label__0 so bad to the point where i actually laughed during parts where it should have been terrifying .
__label__0 a real bad film but i give it a 2 because it is historically important .
__label__0 no , forget 'the phantom menace ' - this one 's even worse ! ''
__label__0 the sets are either obviously something else or so minimal as to be distractingly laughable .
__label__0 this movie is truly one of the worst movies i 've ever seen .
__label__0 horrendous dialogue , terrible editing , and some really bad acting .
__label__0 i never really liked her , but she 's done a lot better movies than this .
__label__0 this movie was seriously the worst movie i have seen since like ever .
__label__0 as an horror movie this simply is a very poor one .
__label__0 the colors used for transition from violent episode to violent episode are disjointed and trite .
__label__0 gordon scott made some good tarzan movies , but this is not one of them .
__label__0 painful to watch , and not entirely for empathy with the struggles of the characters .
__label__0 this film constituted a complete waste of my time .
__label__0 music is boring , and starts to annoy after 15-20 minutes .
__label__0 a great waste of 2 hours time , except that some of the special effects were quite good .
__label__0 there were characters that could have been funny , but they were n't .
__label__0 so bad to the point where i actually laughed during parts where it should have been terrifying .
__label__0 do n't waste your time on this tripe .
__label__0 while the subject matter certainly could be interesting , the storyline and directing really left much to be desired .
__label__0 terminally boring , although the film 's one redeemable feature is the grimy nyc locations .
__label__0 trite , forced , predictable .
__label__0 the movie begins terribly and quickly becomes unwatchable .
__label__0 despite the outstanding cast , their dialogue was , again , boring and their characters were never developed .
__label__0 even their great acting could not redeem this movie 's ridiculous storyline .
__label__0 but the animation ... well , it 's not actually terrible , but it 's definitely cheap and mediocre .
__label__0 john forsythe was so bad and unfunny that he was actually annoying and irritating .
__label__0 the painfully meagre special effects , the shrill music , the leaden plot .
__label__0 and to top it off , night of the sharks has the worst soundtrack i 've ever heard .
__label__0 one of the worst films i have sat through in months .
__label__0 a lifetime of darkness is better than 89 minutes of this .
__label__0 we love you , but we hate it when you waste your talent on crap such as this .
__label__0 it was one of the shortest movies i 've ever seen , and thank god !
__label__0 the opening 45 minutes gave an interesting build up but the rest can only be described as awful .
__label__0 if you have n't read the book , read it and avoid this movie .
__label__0 you do n't sit through this film , you trudge painfully through it .
__label__0 where `` rome '' was risqué and shocking , `` the tudors '' is just empty-headed and smarmy .
__label__0 the jokes are not funny and the acting is horrendous .
__label__0 watching it , i was amazed at how poor the whole thing was from start to finish .
__label__0 it was amusing at times , but really , it was n't very funny at all .
__label__0 no , instead it 's just more of a time-passer and an amazingly unfunny one at that .
__label__0 see it at your own risk .
__label__0 this spoof on alias starts out funny then the stale joke gets quick fast .
__label__0 and even worse , the events are extremely corny and you lose track of what 's happening .
__label__0 i feel blessed to own what is known as the worst steven seagal movie ever made .
__label__0 my friends and i made a super low budget movie , and the effects still exceeded this crap fest .
__label__0 if this was a stand-alone b-movie , i 'd probably give it about a four .
__label__0 there 's no horror , there 's no scares or tension & absolutely no atmosphere .
__label__0 if you want to see art go to an art gallery , do n't watch this movie .
__label__0 the movie however heavily suffers from its weak story and the incoherent story lines with uninteresting and unfunny characters .
__label__0 this one is just a mess , the plot is ... well , where is the plot ?
__label__0 a waste of time and talent .
__label__0 but the characters themselves ... what on earth was so bad about the character wilkinson played ?
__label__0 chillers also features one of the worst closing theme songs ever , period .
__label__0 but despite his square jawed glaring , even his dialogue and part are dismal and forgettable .
__label__0 this movie had nothing to draw you in , and by the end it leaves one feeling unsatisfied .
__label__0 the movie kept going on and on , so i shut it off .
__label__0 i have no idea what they were thinking but this movie is so bad .
__label__0 the characters are not developed and no one cares what happens to them !
__label__0 jared harris is particularly bad , but no one in this is remotely good .
__label__0 i felt genuinely ripped off , longing for satires like spy hard , last action hero , and spaceballs .
__label__0 in terms of historical accuracy , this is the absolute worst roman film i have ever seen .
__label__0 i happened to catch this steaming loaf of a movie while staying at a hotel that had showtime .
__label__0 the only good things are the surprises and the gore .
__label__0 this movie was a total waste of time on all levels .
__label__0 avoid this forever , even if your a gary busey fan please do not watch this .
__label__0 some lines rang so true , and other lines were embarrassingly trite and flat .
__label__0 spare your time and your money for this one .
__label__0 some of the singing is nicely done but the lyrics are ridiculous .
__label__0 judy davis gave a fine performance , but had very little to work with .
__label__0 jean seberg had not one iota of acting talent .
__label__0 i 've sat through several pauly shore movies , but this is the only one that i 've liked .
__label__0 that moment besides , the movie is a downward spiral into the abyss of film making .
__label__0 bottomline : slow , soapy , unsatisfying romance drivel .
__label__0 this was the worst damn movie i 've ever seen !
__label__0 this has to be the worst movie i have seen .
__label__0 and boy were my fears realised - ymca could n't save this one , but liv tyler almost did .
__label__0 the cast is wasted , the writing is stupid and pretentious .
__label__0 the characters were one-dimensional , especially those in the us government .
__label__0 not worth the time ... the u.s. farm report is more interesting than this .
__label__0 bad directing , bad script ... the only really good thing in it was the kid .
__label__0 his character is n't believable and neither is this boring and dreadful film .
__label__0 all of the syrupy comments about the great `` love '' shown by the father are laughable .
__label__0 do not watch this movie sober .
__label__0 this is probably the worst film from japan i 've ever seen .
__label__0 save yourself the time and money and skip this film .
__label__0 the main character is a whiny , irresponsible study of how to throw yourself a pity party .
__label__0 the acting was very bad , the direction was bad .
__label__0 not worth my time ever again .
__label__0 supporting cast is very good , but they ca n't save the final act , which is disappointing .
__label__0 3/10 poor trish lol : the room went red and a magic voice started say may 19th .
__label__0 but the film just takes too long for anything interesting to happen and it becomes very boring to watch .
__label__0 there 's nothing redeeming about this turd except for its beautiful animation .
__label__0 otherwise , do n't even waste your time on this .
__label__0 but the film just takes too long for anything interesting to happen and it becomes very boring to watch .
__label__0 jerky camera-work , scratches on the print , flickering lights ...
__label__0 in conclusion i give this film : 0 stars out of 5
__label__0 really it 's just a mindless shoot-em-up with a very thin plot , and completely disposable characters .
__label__0 but soon after watching the first episode , excitement turned quickly to disappointment and boredom .
__label__0 you will know what i 'm talking about when you see the movie ... 2/10
__label__0 please do yourself a favor , and do n't bother watching this .
__label__0 one of the worst movies i have ever seen .
__label__0 the 'story ' jumped around and the pacing was awful .
__label__0 the films editing is flimsy , the acting is unbearable , and why do they use blue screens ?
__label__0 gene tierney was a very beautiful and talented actress , but she 's totally miscast here .
__label__0 you will see just how aimless and lost this film truly is .
__label__0 i just wonder how on earth an actor like woody strode ended up ia a turkey like this ?
__label__0 the movie is very poorly made , it steals parts from sci-fi flicks , especially alien .
__label__0 trailer seemed nice , but what a let down this was .
__label__0 you ca n't even play the artistic freedom card in this abomination of a film .
__label__0 at this hour , it was n't too censored and i found it virtually unwatchable .
__label__0 the only thing that saves this is some witty dialogue in the beginning during the orientation scenes .
__label__0 this movie was terrible , do n't waste your time on it .
__label__0 cinematography was pretty bad , they could have hired a couple cameramen from a porn movie and done better .
__label__0 bad dialogue , overblown and unrealistic uses of vice , no suspense build-up , and an anti-climactic ending .
__label__0 tedious , not hilarious .
__label__0 this movie is the worst and most stupid i 've ever watched .
__label__0 the filmmakers hoped to elicit some smiles from us but basically made me groan .
__label__0 don´t waste your time !
__label__0 low budget films can still be pleasing to watch , but not this one .
__label__0 there 's nothing compelling , or intriguing about this flick and it 's quite silly actually .
__label__0 do n't waste your time or money on this film .
__label__0 even more so it has no cinematic quality whatsoever .
__label__0 do n't waste your time - i wish i had n't .
__label__0 i fail to understand why anyone would allow a sub-par director to put drivel like this onto celluloid .
__label__0 tony scott destroys anything that may have been interesting in richard kelly 's clichéd , patchy , overwrought screenplay .
__label__0 mrs. van hopper was portrayed all wrong , and maxim was n't handsome and debonair at all .
__label__0 reasons why i gave this show a 3 : 1 .
__label__0 however , `` quintet '' does have one redeeming feature .
__label__0 the whole film is incredibly slow and goes on for far too long .
__label__0 it 's billed as a comedy , but it just is n't very funny .
__label__0 wesley snipes is a far more accomplished actor than to be in this .
__label__0 not scary , not cool , not even very dark , just weak .
__label__0 you ca n't really get behind alex and her dreams because her character is so stupid and shallow .
__label__0 the movies plot had potential to be something great , but it just does n't happen .
__label__0 i cant believe i wasted my time watching this movie .
__label__0 lisa is not only a bigot of the worst sort , but she 's totally unprofessional .
__label__0 there 's not one iota of redeeming cinematic value in all this movies ninety or so minutes .
__label__0 i 'm a big fan of b movies , but dead life is an f at best .
__label__0 if you know anything at all about rugby the match action is boring .
__label__0 there are some interesting camera tricks , some attempts at gruesome gore , but no real scares or tension .
__label__0 killjoy 2 is not even really a movie , so much as an exercise in tension .
__label__0 most of the other actors do n't seem to put that much effort into this tripe .
__label__0 i really wish they had n't wasted their time with this movie and do n't waste your time either !
__label__0 other familiar faces drift through , doing little good for their resumes .
__label__0 overall , very poor , do n't waste your time .
__label__0 childish dialogs , amateurish editing and in general a failed movie .
__label__0 really bad rhyming poetry .
__label__0 the plot could have been fun , had it not been for abysmal interpretation .
__label__0 i was left with the larger impression that this guy 's stand-up act just was n't very funny .
__label__0 this film is so slow that you 'll notice how bad the sets are .
__label__0 the story is pathetic ... the same old tried and tested formula .
__label__0 awful , awful , awful - from screenplay to casting to effects .
__label__0 after seeing 2 minutes of this episode i was utterly utterly disappointed and ashamed .
__label__0 my overall grade is a 3/10 .
__label__0 ..but unfortunately no one thought about having van killed in order to save this doomed production .
__label__0 a few memorable , gruesome bits ca n't compensate for a really poor script .
__label__0 all in all , a very bad made for tv movie experience .
__label__0 the character of the has-been playwright seemed pointless altogether , and wholly predictable .
__label__0 nicky katt was the best actor in this mess .
__label__0 her character is n't likable at all much less funny or anything else .
__label__0 there is little originality to the script , no amusing characters and about four funny lines .
__label__0 the simplistic conclusions about social justice ring hollow and any sympathetic feelings toward romano seem misplaced .
__label__0 this is recommended only if you really feel like watching a bad old school movie .
__label__0 extremely unfunny movie that utterly wastes the usually hilarious hank azaria .
__label__0 a moronic dumb kid 's father is a fighter pilot who gets shot down by some arab country .
__label__0 the plot was corny , tired and absolutely unbelievable .
__label__0 one of the few movies i 've seen that i actually did n't care at all how it ended .
__label__0 the acting was horrible , and the characters unbelievable - borat was more believable than this .
__label__0 the acting was diabolical , it was like porn movie acting , it was terrible .
__label__0 this movie is n't even worth watching it from a videostore !
__label__0 in fact , the return of casey is the only reason i am not giving this a 1-star rating .
__label__0 this film is a real yawner .
__label__0 colin farrell was totally wooden , as was jamie foxx .
__label__0 the plot , what little there is of one , is very predictable .
__label__0 he knows only how to portray women and he is lost in learning to play male roles .
__label__0 brad pitt overacts appallingly .
__label__0 it 's really just a cruddy remake of that old movie with corey haim , silver bullet .
__label__0 there is nothing else worth to say about this movie .
__label__0 the animation with which we see the spirit take control of sherri is beyond awful and rather laughable .
__label__0 did absolutely nothing for me .
__label__0 i think the best acting was performed by salman and priyanka overall , i think its an alright movie !
__label__0 i usually let that slide , but here it just goes too far .
__label__0 the only solace i could find in this really was the intensity that was built up at various points .
__label__0 the characters act without motivation of any kind .
__label__0 julia stiles comes off as a rank amateur ; the cringe factor in her readings is off the meter .
__label__0 i could n't feel empathy for any of the characters in this sleazy film .
__label__0 truly awful early talkie , which plays like something out of an amateur dramatics society .
__label__0 do n't waste your time .
__label__0 the unintelligent show is completely without an edge of any sort .
__label__0 but the treatment 's so over-the-top , so indulgent that it fails to establish any connect .
__label__0 this is the worst time travel movie i have ever seen and i 've seen timeline .
__label__0 max : 4/10 recommendation : borrow it from your friends or just forget about it
__label__0 the plot is weak , the acting 's bad , the situations are totally unbelievable .
__label__0 even the promise of a moderately exciting air chase at the end goes nowhere .
__label__0 i could continue , but it is n't even worth it for such a disappointment of a movie .
__label__0 the ghost cgi & water effects are terrible , it was made-for-tv & it 's shows .
__label__0 my advice if is for anyone suffering from insomnia , this movie will put you 2 sleep !
__label__0 this results in the viewer not being able to identify with anyone other than che , benicio del toro .
__label__0 it 's a great city and it was completely and totally wasted by this movie .
__label__0 it has got to be one of the most dire films i have ever seen .
__label__0 while that may seem a novel concept , the effect is really painful to watch .
__label__0 i really like harrison ford so i eagerly rented this movie only to be disappointed minute after minute .
__label__0 it 's not romance , it 's not action , it 's not noir , it 's not good .
__label__0 you 'd have a better time watching dude where 's my car than this piece of crap !
__label__0 the acting is quite bad , but it 's railsback 's `` performance '' that ruins the movie completely .
__label__0 its insistence on trying to be humorous is what hurts it the most .
__label__0 i think that this is one of his worst performances , totally unfunny or whatsoever .
__label__0 some pretty disturbing images may just be the only redeemable thing about knock , knock .
__label__0 i dare you to find a movie which is worst that this ...
__label__0 legendary in some circles as the biggest cinematic turkey this movie is rightly thought of as a bad movie .
__label__0 1 ) wow , i was not aware that apparently owls eat such animals as cats and pigs !
__label__0 steven seagal movies have never been oscar material but with each passing release they get worse and worse .
__label__0 the characterizations other than liza as sally are uniformly flat .
__label__0 to make a long story short , this is without a doubt the worst film i ever saw .
__label__0 that is why i 'm giving this game 4 of 10 .
__label__0 jolie was a joke with a role with virtually no substance .
__label__0 i think i only watched and suffered through this dud so i could come here and warn everyone .
__label__0 this was one of the worst movies that i have ever watched .
__label__0 i love almereyda 's nadja , but this is just absolute dreck .
__label__0 the dialog is inane .
__label__0 was boring and had no purpose other than further exploration of his character .
__label__0 this movie should get zero stars , can we have a zero star choice please ?
__label__0 these are disgusting , cretinous characters , and i wanted to see as little of them as possible .
__label__0 the actors ca n't hold a cue and are shown making ridiculous and sometimes even illegal shots .
__label__0 all in all , lame , bad , and not worth effort .
__label__0 awful acting and just a generally dumb plot really ruined the name of tarzan for me..
__label__0 to be avoided at all costs .
__label__0 the bad acting is compounded by a script that takes itself way too seriously .
__label__0 i did n't understand any of the characters or their motivations .
__label__0 casper van dien is horrible , text lines , acting .
__label__0 please do not waste your money on this so called film .
__label__0 this was one of the worst and stupidest movies i have ever watched .
__label__0 moreover the famous megalodon , is poorly designed and animated .
__label__0 beyond that , it features a truly bad script with dull , unrealistic dialogue .
__label__0 michael keaton tries making a thriller comeback but ends up missing the target more than ever .
__label__0 avoid at all costs .
__label__0 that 's not necessarily bad in itself , but there 's nothing to make up for the barren settings .
__label__0 he has no interest , intelligence , important lines , or memorable scenes .
__label__0 the plot reads like a bad dungeons and dragons hack but with plasma rifles and force fields .
__label__0 the characters are shallow and trite as are the dialog and plot line .
__label__0 1 ) the direction and editing are awful , just awful .
__label__0 camera : speaking of frenetic , the trademark greengrass shaky cam was present and very annoying to me .
__label__0 everyone 's character seemed to become mechanical .
__label__0 what 's even worse is that the battles are n't even that impressive .
__label__0 i could n't make heads or tails out of this terrible film noir .
__label__0 it ranks right up there with uncle sam on the all time worst movies ever made .
__label__0 the emotional scenes are intended to pull at our heart strings but they 're just awful .
__label__0 an hour and 10 minutes into the movie i 'm prepared to give this a 2/10 .
__label__0 this is almost certainly the worst western i 've ever seen .
__label__0 audiences will become mindless idiots , as they are sat for 90 minutes and watching complete drivel .
__label__0 lousy gags , bad music , poor drawings and animation ...
__label__0 i like chris rock , but i feel he is wasted in this film .
__label__0 do not watch this film .
__label__0 the photography offers nothing in terms of visual meaning or interesting shots .
__label__0 i was astonished by the barrage of bad f/x , lousy acting and poor story telling .
__label__0 it was absolutely agonizing to watch and had nothing to offer the genre .
__label__0 this film has the worst acting i 've ever seen .
__label__0 not only was the script atrocious , but the casting people should be shot .
__label__0 it 's like being stuck in a lift with the world 's most boring man .
__label__0 i swear , i actually felt nauseated after watching this festering pile of manure .
__label__0 it leaves a very bad taste in the mouth indeed .
__label__0 this is one of the films that killed the `` spaghetti '' western .
__label__0 the costumes were horrible , the music was horrible , and the writing was beyond horrible ! !
__label__0 the cover is poorly drawn disney schlock , clearly grabbing for an easy buck from an unsuspecting parent .
__label__0 movies like this make battlefield earth look like a star wars it is so bad .
__label__0 the story is not at all compelling , and you will probably find yourself bored and/or furious .
__label__0 the rest of the cast is equally atrocious .
__label__0 not good ... just awful .
__label__0 when the actors do stop to give their lines , the result is often unintentionally humorous .
__label__0 with that scene the movie hits rock bottom and then against all odds proceeds to go further downhill .
__label__0 the overall film is wretched -- far worse than any other wheeler & woolsey film i have seen .
__label__0 sixth , with the exception of david warner 's , the acting is stilted and amateurish .
__label__0 it is amazing how good actors can do such bad movies .
__label__0 i feel real sorry for her to have to star in this super low budget soft-porn no brainer .
__label__0 hard to sit through , scenes that went nowhere , and a soundtrack that made me want to vomit .
__label__0 the story was just plain bad and obnoxious .
__label__0 this is the worst movie i have ever seen .
__label__0 overall skip this one at all costs !
__label__0 the film was also quite long drawn , the camera work was uninteresting and the editing was dull .
__label__0 unless you are totally into `` lesbian sex sounds '' stay away from this horribly made piece of junk .
__label__0 i took one for the team watching this one , so take my advice , do n't bother .
__label__0 all in all , this movie was completely dull and unengaging .
__label__0 daytime scenes inexplicably turning into night-time scenes , then suddenly back to daytime .
__label__0 the theater was dead with silence 'cause everyone was embarrassed to be in there watching such trash .
__label__0 hogan 's direction is pedestrian and the story is somewhat interesting but very contrived .
__label__0 do n't waste your time on it .
__label__0 however , it was agonizing to watch , so i 'll give it a 1 out of spite .
__label__0 do n't watch this .
__label__0 but , the songs and dances are virtually the only good things in the movie .
__label__0 if seeing people tortured is not your idea of fun , then stay away from this film .
__label__0 i 'm not sure how this was accomplished , but blood of the vampire is both ghastly and dull .
__label__0 the basic story line is ridiculous , the dialogue is horrible and this moves at a snails pace .
__label__0 both had potential in their own right , but they just seem to go nowhere .
__label__0 i am willing to tolerate almost anything in a sci-fi movie , but this was almost intolerable .
__label__0 he should have been fascinating , but he was n't in this movie .
__label__0 this is an absolutely horrible film in every way possible .
__label__0 it 's a lousy script with crappy characters and really naff acting and direction .
__label__0 even clint , the hero , generates no sympathy in the least .
__label__0 and that 's when it struck me : this is one of the worst movies i 've seen .
__label__0 my vote is one .
__label__0 i was really fed up watching the first half itself not to mention about the second half .
__label__0 the plot was so stupid that it borders on the criminal .
__label__0 the inconsistent plot starts with a guy raping and murdering a woman stranded at the side of the road .
__label__0 the actors are bad , the jokes are not funny and the plots are plain stupid .
__label__0 showing us a skeleton in the lab lit with a green light is just not scary .
__label__0 the writing is flat , the characters muted , the direction stilted .
__label__0 first of all , the movie is offensive to arabs .
__label__0 the characters are mostly standard horror film clichés & quickly became annoying .
__label__0 one more gripe : the stylized animation , although meant to be hip just seemed unappealing .
__label__0 no , actually this is one of the worst movies ever .
__label__0 all i can say about this movie , is it is absolutely boring .
__label__0 it was like watching the family stone minus the funny improvisational parts and extending the bad hollywood movie parts .
__label__0 i actually want my 27 minutes back of my life that i spent watching this piece of crap .
__label__0 the stop motion animation was okay but the plots were banal and overall it seemed amateurish .
__label__0 the only thing that makes this one watchable is corey 's performance as the lunatic killer on the loose .
__label__0 bettany just passes time as his talent is squandered on a second-rate villain .
__label__0 allan joslyn is not too entertaining and we could have done without him .
__label__0 the acting is atrocious ; the music is lousy even though it is grieg .
__label__0 the plot is so bad that you wonder if the screenwriter is 4 years old .
__label__0 this is the worst film i 've ever seen in my life .
__label__0 the action sequences are nothing special or exciting , but confusing .
__label__0 i 'm a huge randolph scott fan , but this film is a dud .
__label__0 first off , the construction of the screenplay and editing was utterly atrocious , even by horror movie standards .
__label__0 how do you take a cast of experienced , well-known actors , and put together such a stupid movie ?
__label__0 an awful awful movie .
__label__0 just do n't watch this film .
__label__0 this is one of the worst movies i have seen in years !
__label__0 and the violence tries to be more brutal than in the first film but it fails pretty miserably .
__label__0 her performance is incredibly over-dramatic and overwrought in every way .
__label__0 i would not recommend this film to anyone .
__label__0 this film could have been interesting , but it was n't .
__label__0 clearly a waste of the time of a talented cast and director .
__label__0 i usually watch the whole thing but this is unbearable !
__label__0 i like zombie movies , and i like japanese movies , but this one was just too amateurish .
__label__0 characterization is thin at best , no thanks to weak dialogue and soporific direction .
__label__0 the special effects were second-rate at best , with obvious seams visible and cgi clearly recognizable .
__label__0 but , despite good acting by robert young and eve arden , the movie is a mess .
__label__0 there 's no tension and the storyline is extremely thin .
__label__0 do n't ever pick this up .
__label__0 this movie pretends to be insightful but it 's not .
__label__0 there were some shots that stood out , but over all there were nothing exiting about the cinematography .
__label__0 one of the worst theatrical movies of the year , if not all time .
__label__0 watching the main character walk around endlessly without saying or doing anything is just garbage film-making .
__label__0 she a very pretty woman , but as an actress , she consistently sub-par .
__label__0 all style and no substance .
__label__0 i give this movie a 4 cause i 'm a die hard fan of the video game series .
__label__0 the imagery is n't all that colorful , either , certainly not matching dario 's worst movies .
__label__0 this must be one of the worst movies ever made in recent history .
__label__0 there is nothing else worth to say about this movie .
__label__0 the special effects have no effect whatsoever - except inducing complete disbelief .
__label__0 i vote a 2 only because ralph looked so stunning .
__label__0 the writing was terrible , the animation was terrible , and by anime standards this is just awful .
__label__0 this film must break some record for worst written and delivered lines .
__label__0 total waste of time .
__label__0 the idea is actually great but the execution is sorely lacking in every aspect .
__label__0 never see this movie .
__label__0 what could have been a great movie for all actors , turned out to be a b-movie at best .
__label__0 the movie 's other redeeming quality is eastwood 's direction .
__label__0 while i could go on about the chases and how they ruin a decent story , i wo n't .
__label__0 whenever disney characters reach adulthood these days they become either obnoxious or just plain boring .
__label__0 but you have to fork over money one way or another to see this turkey .
__label__0 what could have been an interesting idea was spoilt by the lack of any character development .
__label__0 yeah , rat race has its moments , but a great deal of it irritated me .
__label__0 this is a bad , bad attempt at a smart drama .
__label__0 cast of really obnoxious teens and profane adults could n't die fast enough as far as i was concerned .
__label__0 my word of advice for wary b-movie fans is if it says olen ray stay away !
__label__0 in other words , do n't waste your time watching this .
__label__0 this film is very boring and so long .
__label__0 some people can make fascinating movies without real action , but not this one .
__label__0 the acting was horrible , i 'm surprised dennis could even get a career after this .
__label__0 bad drama composition is worst about this film as plot on killing hitler suppose to be pretty dramatic event .
__label__0 very little of this movie feels real , it feels like play someone was staging on saturday afternoon .
__label__0 the movie is boring , long , and devoid of believable characters or situations .
__label__0 this movie has an interesting enough story , but it plays out very bad here .
__label__0 in `` hobgoblins '' i hated the actors ... and everyone else involved in creating this atrocity .
__label__0 then we have richard widmark who has the most ludicrously written part in the picture !
__label__0 gina 's great , but not even she could save this one .
__label__0 this movie is just so awful , and the songs in this are terrible !
__label__0 even sandra looked like hell , positively fat .
__label__0 even a cast featuring john travolta and lisa kudrow could not make this picture worth seeing .
__label__0 i realized there were humorous parts , but i did n't laugh .
__label__0 this is one of the worst movies i have ever seen .
__label__0 truly , a man born in the wrong century .
__label__0 this film has to be one of the worst produced in 1981 .
__label__0 bottom line : this movie sucked from opening propaganda to final stunt .
__label__0 any government that could let gary collins live through an entire movie just has to be full of idiots .
__label__0 big bad wolf is another in a long line of attempts to make a good werewolf movie .
__label__0 i gave it a 2 for a three reasons : 1 .
__label__0 bad points of film : irrelevant scenes , boring , lacks in horror genre .
__label__0 the characters are completely one-dimensional and have no motivation for anything they do .
__label__0 if the flick has anything at all going for it , it 's b-movie diva rubin 's even performance .
__label__0 the first 20 to 30 minutes is bearable then this movie is like a drag !
__label__0 and the cockpit voice recording that was miraculously found , it was totally useless for establishing what happened .
__label__0 the overall movie itself is utterly boring , and hardly funny at all .
__label__0 like our poor , but beautiful protagonist , i felt used , dirty , cheap ... .
__label__0 filled with references glorifying evil , and an annoying soundtrack it 's sure to rub hundreds the wrong way .
__label__0 this may have been the single worst large studio production i have ever seen .
__label__0 yes kids like 8 to 10 might enjoy but its really stupid .
__label__0 being passionate about cinema and world cinema in particular , i walked away incredibly frustrated .
__label__0 and a mysterious fog and the mysterious disappearance of millions of mexicans is a stupid , childish joke .
__label__0 shameless waste of my time as a viewer .
__label__0 bad acting , i 'm sorry to say , did not help to enjoy this rather sticky screenplay .
__label__0 the writing was bland .
__label__0 not only was the plot was difficult to follow , but it seems character development was randomly applied .
__label__0 this is recommended only if you really feel like watching a bad old school movie .
__label__0 this was the 2nd worst movie i have seen to date .
__label__0 the story may have been original , but the direction sure was n't .
__label__0 this movie is not worth seeing , at least not at a cinema .
__label__0 the villains in the movie do not seem the slightest bit scary .
__label__0 i believe i smiled once or twice at a couple cute lines , but that 's it .
__label__0 hide and creep is by far one of the all time worst films ever made .
__label__0 it 's one redeeming feature is that the very lovely diane franklin is on screen for most of the film
__label__0 this film is by one of the worst movies i have seen this year .
__label__0 i wanted to see an action comedy with a satirical twist but this one failed me miserably .
__label__0 i actually disliked the leading characters so much that their antics were never funny but pathetic .
__label__0 you wo n't even get any laughs out of the utter ineptitude on display ... trust me .
__label__0 chris pine fights to keep himself above the surface whilst being drowned by a misery of a lightweight cast .
__label__0 how could such tasteless , extremely unfunny drivel come from such a pool of apparent talent ! !
__label__0 mos def ruined the movie all on his own , but willis did n't really do anything stop him .
__label__0 the lighting is awful .
__label__0 the whole plot characters , story line , narrative arc goes nowhere .
__label__0 there are a few good laughs , but it 's very inconsistent .
__label__0 the captain 's super powers seem to be limited to throwing his shield and faking car sickness .
__label__0 the actors did n't even seem to be into their parts and seemed quite lifeless and listless .
__label__0 do n't waste your time .
__label__0 if you like these , do n't watch this movie .
__label__0 i like all this movie crew and dark humor movies ; but did n't like this one at all !
__label__0 gone is the plot , mystery , the dark aspects of the first ... a sham .
__label__0 so kids do n't waste your cash on this crap buy hostel instead .
__label__0 the acting is horrendously mediocre , the plot is derivative , with no compelling or appealing characters whatsoever .
__label__0 why spend more than two hours watching this mess of a film .
__label__0 do n't waste 2 hours of your life on this .
__label__0 in retrospect , i wonder why i even gave it a `` 3 '' .
__label__0 these were older characters and actors doing superficial horny 20-something lives - just sort of annoying and wrong feeling .
__label__0 considering the talent involved , this has to be one of the worst movies i 've ever seen .
__label__0 so what i 'm going to do is list the top five things wrong with this film 1 .
__label__0 this movie is a slap in the face to anyone who payed money for this .
__label__0 what little dialogue there is in the movie is as inane and nonsensical as the images .
__label__0 project kill is the worst movie i have ever seen .
__label__0 from a cinematic point of view it is probably one of the worst films i have encountered absolutely dire .
__label__0 horror nor gore approaches that of robocop 2 and the effects are ... missing .
__label__0 final rating : 1/10 i wish i could give it a zero .
__label__0 i would not recommend this movie to anyone .
__label__0 the plot is ridiculous , the acting pretty much non-existent - then again , ninja ca n't act !
__label__0 the story is cloying , insulting and stupid , as might be expected for a movie in this genre .
__label__0 however , in step brothers it is not funny , just depressing , mean-spirited and reprehensible .
__label__0 i also found the lord fenton absolutely appalling and i did not like his character .
__label__0 subplot with the corporate law firm was a complete waste of time .
__label__0 if you like and are intrigued by good films , stay clear of this turkey .
__label__0 and i repeat , please do not see this movie !
__label__0 other than some pretty good special effects , and set designs , nothing about descent is worthwhile .
__label__0 no emotion , no real sense of direction , and a whole ton of intense swearing .
__label__0 the story is contrived with sub-plots that add nothing to the narrative .
__label__0 i love that scene , but the movie is a very bad movie .
__label__0 the only time the movie has any energy or humor is when frank morgan is on camera .
__label__0 i would rather be stretched on the rack than sit through this atrocity again .
__label__0 unfortunately , there 's very little else to recommend this seasonal stinker .
__label__0 everything that could possibly go wrong actually features here in this lame horror vehicle .
__label__0 evie , especially , is one of the most unsympathetic characters you 'll meet in a film this year .
__label__0 the casting did nothing but increase the cheese factor exponentially , i 'm afraid .
__label__0 it could have ended 3 different places but it just kept going on to a mostly predictable hollywood ending .
__label__0 not one good thing to say about this crap movie .
__label__0 this film is probably the worst film that i have ever seen .
__label__0 4 ) natalie portman has never been in a strip club .
__label__0 the whole movie it feels like you 're watching a guy trying to hard to impress beyond his abilities .
__label__0 lack of scares , lack of atmosphere , lack of interesting story .
__label__0 avoid this at all costs , and add 90 precious minutes to your life .
__label__0 in spite of everything , i gave this flick a 4 out of 10 .
__label__0 do some insane stuff and have my adrenaline pumping but these guys ... just scripted stupid reactions .
__label__0 i do n't say it often , but this film was bad .
__label__0 a plot that is dumb beyond belief .
__label__0 the set was way too functional and futuristic for the 22nd century , especially for an old mining ship .
__label__0 never would i recommend this movie to my worst enemy , yet anybody i actually like .
__label__0 maybe the worse movie i have ever see .
__label__0 supposed to be funny , but it 's not .
__label__0 stephen dorff & reese witherspoon just waste there time & talents in a really wasted script .
__label__0 avoid this at all costs .
__label__0 but not only is this film bad in artistic value , it 's incredibly boring .
__label__0 you want to feel sad or happy or empathetic or something ; you just feel bored .
__label__0 it completely fails as an addition to both series , and it fails as a film itself .
__label__0 the plot in the film is unbelievably boring and goes virtually nowhere throughout the film .
__label__0 this movie i totally not funny , and i would imagine to be pretty offensive to jewish people .
__label__0 low quality effects , bad actors , and it seems like it 's shot by an amateur camcorder .
__label__0 this film tries to be a serious and sophisticated thriller/horror flick and it fails miserably .
__label__0 as such , the film 's only real saving grace is the luminous presence of anne hathaway .
__label__0 it does have a promising premise , but it is done all wrong .
__label__0 i found nothing in particular to recommend this one .
__label__0 it may list as 111 minutes but feels like three hours of painfully wasted time .
__label__0 this movie is so bad and so frustrating that i just had to do it .
__label__0 second i find the hoffmann character not that convincing anymore after his `` accident '' .
__label__0 the dialogue is terrible and it seems that few lines are spoken without the f-word being used .
__label__0 bad script , bad direction and horrible acting make this one plain bad !
__label__0 no way to understand the actions of kitano , or most of the other members of his family .
__label__0 i could complain a lot more about this film , but why waste my time .
__label__0 another poorly written script for a donkey director for no-talent offspring of past movie stars .
__label__0 along three quarters of the movie , catherine just seems to be mentally retarded , poor thing .
__label__0 the dialogue is so unrealistic , and their entirely insincere portrayal of it emphasizes this even more .
__label__0 that is , without that one cure , substance ... something this movie has very little of .
__label__0 it started off well but then it went all wrong for me .
__label__0 there are few , if any , redeeming moments to be found .
__label__0 great stunts , decent story , good fight scenes , but some of the action was just plain silly .
__label__0 after the plane crash the movie keeps going on and on with pointless melodramatic scenes .
__label__0 all of the cast members are wasted in this lackluster effort , including eddie murphy himself .
__label__0 please do n't waste you 're time buying and watching this movie its totally crap .
__label__0 it never transcends its influences , and is thus , in the end , generic and forgettable .
__label__0 the scenery is ponderous and gaudy , the acting for the most part is terrible .
__label__0 the acting , by and large , failed to transcend this directorial flatness of an idea forced into film .
__label__0 anna paquin as the lead character sookie , is just awful .
__label__0 the script was terrible , full of too many clichés , and awful one-liners .
__label__0 the african location is pretty enough but that is basically all this film has going for it .
__label__0 their trouble delivering lines was made even more obvious by horrible sound design .
__label__0 terrible movie made on zero budget .
__label__0 this is not only one of his worst but one of the most horrifying movies i 've ever seen .
__label__0 plus , the whole special ability and being a hero idea is a total duplicate of x-men .
__label__0 it started out well ; but , soon became boring and frankly idiotic after a while .
__label__0 it 's so unintentionally funny , you have to wonder , is craven playing a joke on this ?
__label__0 the acting is poor , the creatures are poor , hell , even danny trejo is poor .
__label__0 do n't waste your time if you want to be entertained .
__label__0 matt dillon , a fine , intense actor is totally miscast here and is stiff and mannered .
__label__0 it may be notable for the first appearance of donald duck but the rest of it is mainly annoying .
__label__0 one of the worst , slowest moving , dumb `` westerns '' you will ever see .
__label__0 there was just no reason for me to actually care about anyone involved in the movie .
__label__0 the overlong chase sequence , for example , is the least spectacular one in the history of cinema .
__label__0 begrudgingly gave it a 3 - one point each for fonda , stanwyck , and the supporting cast .
__label__0 the whole thing is really very dull .
__label__0 first , poorly written dialogue .
__label__0 i tried to find the talent they were showcasing , and it too was terrible .
__label__0 i 'm very disappointed by this `` adaption '' of the famous book .
__label__0 it had absolutely nothing to do with surfing .
__label__0 shot almost entirely in television style close ups , this film is an insult to intelligence .
__label__0 this movie is not worth sitting through ... even for nick .
__label__0 if you are a parent , please avoid this like the plague .
__label__0 astonishingly inept writing , direction , production , at every level , even for a tv movie .
__label__0 the dialog was cheesy , the premise was stupid , and the camera work was poorly done .
__label__0 the one saving grace of this character is that she is played by gillian anderson .
__label__0 worst of all is the overlong ` zion rave ' scene .
__label__0 my rating : 2/10 .
__label__0 this is perhaps one of the worst horror films i have ever seen !
__label__0 put simply this is probably the worst film i have ever seen !
__label__0 i really felt bad for this guy , because he was a putrid , horrible actor .
__label__0 2/10 writer , story makes no sense at all and has huge amount of flaws .
__label__0 one of the worst films i 've ever seen ! .
__label__0 warning : watch this movie at your own risk ! !
__label__0 the cast try gamely , but are hamstrung by the screenplay , which generally makes no sense .
__label__0 this is the first woody allen film i 've found not worth watching .
__label__0 2 ) the `` flies '' in this movie look nothing like real flies .
__label__0 well , i give it a 2 for the gore , but otherwise this film is worthless .
__label__0 george clooney aims to portray mr. fox as charming and sleek , but his voice has no character .
__label__0 it is the writing , acting , and direction that make this so awful .
__label__0 spend your time and money elsewhere , this is not worth watching .
__label__0 i thought it was funny , but as with most all comedies , it was n't that funny .
__label__0 characters appear and disappear at random , and the film is loaded with pointless , confusing cutaways .
__label__0 a film like this lives or dies by its effects , and quite frankly this film is dead !
__label__0 amy adams gives one of the worst performances of all time .
__label__0 this movie had so much potential to be good , but ultimately made nothing of it .
__label__0 in my opinion it has destroyed all positive intentions of producers .
__label__0 horror fans , do yourself a favor and skip out on this one .
__label__0 the pacing is painfully and excruciatingly slow , that even after 40 minutes of the film nothing happens much .
__label__0 next to rock-a-doodle , this is one of bluth 's worst .
__label__0 the routine musical score is basically non-existent in creating any sense of mood and falls flat .
__label__0 i had to feel for george zucco a talented actor who got stuck in this mess .
__label__0 then it goes completely downhill and turns into a whole catalog of `` your basic slasher clichés '' .
__label__0 the only good fight scene was between the brother and shen .
__label__0 its a linear plot with no development and surprises in any way .
__label__0 i 'd rather listen to jonas brothers than have to watch an episode of this ever again .
__label__0 this movie was so bad , i thought i was going to scream in the middle of it .
__label__0 most people wont watch it anyway so why am i wasting time writing this ?
__label__0 there was no abigail crain , there was no `` companion '' , and there was no nursery .
__label__0 the movie also tries to shock with explicit cursing so ... 2/10
__label__0 the actors playing the main roles tried hard but charles came out looking like a social misfit .
__label__0 this show appears to be a vehicle for brad garrett , who 's talents i think are very limited .
__label__0 it starts good but in the middle of the movie gets boring .
__label__0 i will always give good movies their due , but this movie was terrible .
__label__0 the premise is just way too unique to be left alone with this uneven flick
__label__0 but here , the young actress portraying the besieged daughter presented a listless performance .
__label__0 this is truly one of the worst movies i 've ever seen .
__label__0 why is werner herzog wasting his good talents and time with junk like this ?
__label__0 only see this movie if you are desperate , or really appreciate anyone in the film .
__label__0 it is so corny i can not fathom too many people actually sitting through the entire hour-and-a-half .
__label__0 that brings me the most irritating track of the film - salman khan and priyanka chopra .
__label__0 a weak film that starts of strong and quickly goes nowhere .
__label__0 the sets are unbelievably ugly -- - and clearly a waste of millions of dollars .
__label__0 terrence howard could n't even save this lame piece of work called a film .
__label__0 i do n't even know why i gave this movie a rating of 2 .
__label__0 all of the supporting characters were one-dimensional , and only seemed somewhat familiar with human interaction on planet earth .
__label__0 do yourself a favor , change the channel when this rip off tries to disgrace your screen !
__label__0 overall , not even worth a $ 1 rental .
__label__0 the script is full of holes from beginning to end .
__label__0 overall , the movie is boring .
__label__0 chillers also features one of the worst closing theme songs ever , period .
__label__0 miss davis looks like she would rather be somewhere else and has little to do .
__label__0 a lot of people in the cinema enjoyed this film , but it only made me feel misanthropic .
__label__0 a seemingly endless movie that really deserves a zero rating .
__label__0 the screenwriter seems to be trying to portray the believers as crazy , as well .
__label__0 i 'll give it to you straight : this movie is a stupid , boring waste of time .
__label__0 the dialog tries to be clever and fails .
__label__0 that 's what happens in a nutshell for another tired retread of the teen gross out genre .
__label__0 having now wasted a glorious saturday afternoon , i feel immensely cheated .
__label__0 all in all , this movie is a waste of time .
__label__0 if you try to rate this as a regular movie , then this is bottom of the line drivel .
__label__0 it seems john carpenter must 've known we 'd be sleeping ourselves through this movie .
__label__0 subplot with the corporate law firm was a complete waste of time .
__label__0 again and again , you see winters on edge and it ultimately culminates in very bad things ! !
__label__0 the plot was ok but the best way to describe this movie is just plain boring .
__label__0 my advice to anyone wanting to see this film : do n't waste your time .
__label__0 ok , three words : worst movie ever ! ! !
__label__0 in rating this from one to ten i give it a low 2 .
__label__0 the story are trite , annoying , irritating , and aggravating .
__label__0 the acting is bad , except for paul rudd , and donald pleasence .
__label__0 the lds references were frequent and heavy-handed .
__label__0 i give it `` 3 '' only because of meryl and vanessa .
__label__0 for the range i was allowed , i 'll give it a 1 .
__label__0 the acting was fairly decent , but james russo should stick to acting , not writing .
__label__0 i am a fan of b horror , and i have certainly seen worse , much worse .
__label__0 everything was so obvious , so run of the mill , so pointless .
__label__0 brandy deserves better than this film , its lame script , and perverted mel .
__label__0 avoid this show at all costs , it 's terrible and ridiculous .
__label__0 having her play the head of the president 's secret service was a stroke of very poor casting .
__label__0 it is painful to watch , worse that the worst snl skits you 've ever seen .
__label__0 the power started off looking promising but soon became boring and tedious to watch .
__label__0 his story is not shocking , merely self indulgent and boring .
__label__0 this is a terrible movie that only gets worse and seems to never end .
__label__0 live action anime without any action , or indeed any life .
__label__0 i ca n't believe they do this kind of filth out of a serious theme .
__label__0 there are n't any big emotional payoffs or any neat plot twists .
__label__0 the dialogue , terribly stilted , is delivered by non-actors on all counts .
__label__0 1- stephen baldwin does n't care about his involvement in stephen baldwin vehicles .
__label__0 the inane laughing between the two main characters and the pitiful dialog made me want to cry .
__label__0 what was joan crawford thinking when she accepted this incredibly bad 1937 vehicle ?
__label__0 the dialogue is extremely poor and apart from karloff , the acting is really bad too .
__label__0 junk , forget it , do n't waste your time etc etc
__label__0 this film is a dull , shoddy mess , filled with every comic book you can think of .
__label__0 the soundtrack was tedious .
__label__0 the staging , color coordination and whatever else went into making this movie was alienating at best .
__label__0 it is n't meant to be ambiguous and open to interpretation , it is just poorly done .
__label__0 the only redeeming quality of the movie is the exquisite beauty of the leading actresses .
__label__0 this is an awful re-make of the u.s. movie `` wide awake '' by the british !
__label__0 well , in this awful offering , they could at least count the money they saved on sets .
__label__0 this may very well be the worst movie ever made .
__label__0 this is basically a ghetto version of `` road trip , '' which also sucked .
__label__0 i do n't know what else to say about it but its awful .
__label__0 i 've never been so disappointed in a movie in all my life .
__label__0 it 's boring , implausible , poorly shot , ridiculously scripted , and lacking in cool disaster effects .
__label__0 not much to say about him , besides this is a role made for him .
__label__0 with a forgettable plot , painful dialog and non-existent directing , this is a waste of film .
__label__0 the dialog is trite and , dare i say it again , unoriginal .
__label__0 i would rather get whipped 100 times than watch this horrible piece of s**t ever again .
__label__0 i found the film episodic , pointless , boring and brutal with no point of view .
__label__0 fifteen minutes of plot that really did n't do much .
__label__0 the dog is at best ugly , never really scary .
__label__0 not much else to say about this garbled garbage .
__label__0 the actors perform their lines effectively , but nothing they say or do is remotely believable .
__label__0 please , do n't see this movie .
__label__0 what was joan crawford thinking when she accepted this incredibly bad 1937 vehicle ?
__label__0 i had never even heard of this film and perhaps for good reason -- it is awful .
__label__0 it is not worth your time , except for a laugh .
__label__0 and for that reason i found this movie painfully self indulgent and spiritually draining .
__label__0 life is too short , > avoid avoid avoid avoid < .
__label__0 the acting is horrible and the little bit of special effects is below `` b '' movie quality stuff .
__label__0 i give the movie 2 out of 10 - and thats only because of rose .
__label__0 it has no endearing , entertaining , or even comedic properties in comparison to it 's bad everything else .
__label__0 some scenes seemed promising , playing with visual dimensions , but could n't hold up the rest .
__label__0 finally , the film seemed to have no point whatsoever , expressing nothing , achieving nothing .
__label__0 it is the absolute nadir in the mostly embarrassing culture of lds filmmaking .
__label__0 please understand : while i admire ruth gordon 's performance , her character really , *really* irritates me .
__label__0 then we get onto the human actors , and well the majority of atrocious .
__label__0 the only good thing about this movie was the score but again not as good as the original .
__label__0 the dialogue and delivery come straight out of a lesser 1950 's program along with the overdone physical emoting .
__label__0 spoilers straight to the point , just like many other sequels , this is a woeful film .
__label__0 it sounds better if you do n't have to look at this failure of super production .
__label__0 just do n't go to watch it ; i request you to feel the feel of saawariya !
__label__0 this one is maybe the worst movie ever made about the eternal legend of camelot and the king arthur .
__label__0 samuel l. jackson narrates the thing , and really just wastes time .
__label__0 it 's simply not very funny , and very little like the earlier films they 'd made .
__label__0 i give it 4 because reno was so good in leon .
__label__0 i do n't recommend this to anyone but the target audience .
__label__0 shot badly , bad effects , worse acting .
__label__0 a horrible mess of a script , crappy acting and garbage miniature effects .
__label__0 the direction was the second worst part of the movie , i guess some people have no artistic vision .
__label__0 after the splendor of the first film this came as a massive dissapointment .
__label__0 this is far the most worst film i 've seen this year from bollywood so far .
__label__0 this is a painfully boring film that has little or nothing in the way of interest .
__label__0 i would not recommend this movie in any way to anyone .
__label__0 this show 's nothing more than the worst slapstick .
__label__0 this film had very little to offer anyone that appreciates good movies .
__label__0 i spent 90 minutes of my precious life watching one of the dumbest movies i 've ever seen .
__label__0 if one is interested in the films of rebane i would recommend almost any other over this .
__label__0 i give it a 3 out of 10 , and then only for laughs .
__label__0 the acting was watchable i 'll give it that , but the entire movie was just too out there .
__label__0 i also saw this amazingly bad piece of `` anime '' at the london sci-fi festival .
__label__0 everyone involved in this project is doing the worst thing they 've ever done .
__label__0 some gory but silly deaths help , but the film is strictly amateur night and boring beyond belief .
__label__0 i could relate to kurt , i certainly could n't relate to this `` david sloan '' .
__label__0 death screams aka house of death is so bad and boring i give it 0/10 .
__label__0 i have never been so disappointed in a movie character before .
__label__0 the ending says it all for the whole storyline - a complete and total disappointment .
__label__0 as well directed as can be expected , but basically incoherent .
__label__0 i do not recommend this movie to anyone , well maybe to my enemies lol .
__label__0 the soundtrack is awful and the songs are just a copy of the ones from the previous film .
__label__0 there is nothing slightly humorous about a kidnapping .
__label__0 bland , disappointing and sometimes even tiresome .
__label__0 the acting is inept , and the plot is exactly what we 'd expect from this type of movie .
__label__0 full disclosure : i hit my limit and stopped watching the movie about a half-hour into it .
__label__0 the story ... the acting ... the special effects ... all fall flat ! ! !
__label__0 bad directing , bad effects and the worst script in the world .
__label__0 the 'plot ' , such as it is , is totally incomprehensible .
__label__0 this was probably the worst movie based on a book that i 've ever seen .
__label__0 harvey keitel and andie macdowell were good but some of the other actors were n't at all believable .
__label__0 the 3 male leads are all annoying .
__label__0 terrible special effects that tried to reach far beyond the limitations of the budget .
__label__0 then there is the limp plot - about as much depth as a scooby doo cartoon .
__label__0 the story is bereft of any new ideas and the phallic imagery is rather puerile .
__label__0 my advice : although having a great lobby , do not waste your time and money in this crap .
__label__0 the blind guy has no funny parts either , you basically have to force yourself to laugh .
__label__0 i am being honest when i 'm saying that this is the worst movie i 've ever seen .
__label__0 there are a couple of funny scenes but they are few and far between .
__label__0 i give some low budget movies a chance , but this one started out lame .
__label__0 do n't waste your time or money on this film you will be sorely disappointed .
__label__0 then there 's that music ... it 's so flat and boring .
__label__0 this was one of the most awful , insufferable australian movies i have ever seen .
__label__0 almost all of hitchcock 's films in the 1940 's were masterpieces -- - except for this turgid potboiler .
__label__0 so , aside from 3 roles played damn well this film is a big ole ' dud .
__label__0 this film has nothing i like and it 's a total waste of time to look at .
__label__0 please , stay away from this movie , do not waste your eyes on it .
__label__0 do n't see this movie .
__label__0 never seen a such a weak performance by pitt ... and the rest ?
__label__0 there is n't one single sincere sounding line in the entire movie .
__label__0 this one was boringly classic - there were three fights with the bad guys , following the standard procedure .
__label__0 the plot and story is bad , cheesy and predictable .
__label__0 and the obvious comedic pieces , i defy anybody to watch them and not sit there stone-faced .
__label__0 while not the worst recent urban horror movie , there 's still nothing worth recommending here .
__label__0 this film honestly has no guts , spunk , or attitude that the first film had .
__label__0 this show is perhaps one of the most boring , most unfunny shows i 've ever seen .
__label__0 lines that are supposed to be significant are incomprehensible .
__label__0 the rest is characters walking around aimlessly and poorly rendered effects shots .
__label__0 there 's not a single scary moment in this boring albeit well made hammer entry .
__label__0 this has got to be one of the worst movies ever made .
__label__0 i 'm a sucker for a good pirate movie , but this ai n't it .
__label__0 the special effects look extremely cheap and are mostly stop-motion .
__label__0 i have heard that this movie is supposed to be funny , but it 's not .
__label__0 it was a cheap , quickly assembled and uninteresting knockoff of the road warrior flicks .
__label__0 the flashback structure means that you know exactly who survives at the end , so there 's no suspense .
__label__0 being made by sega i did n't expect much , but i also did n't expect this junk either .
__label__0 the images have little to do with what story line there is , which is n't much .
__label__0 although this film has had a lot of praise , i personally found it boring .
__label__0 it could have worked but it just does n't .
__label__0 i know humor was different back in the late 1930s , but this was just plain dumb .
__label__0 all in all , i would not recommend this movie .
__label__0 sympathy for lady vengeance is just another run-of-the-mill vengeance story with nothing even slightly memorable about it .
__label__0 you sit there in a stupor waiting for it to get entertaining , but it never does .
__label__0 the dialog is poorly written , cliché-ridden and woodenly delivered .
__label__0 i am utterly disappointed in this installment of hp !
__label__1 what is so hard to comprehend is - why did n't they make more musical shorts like this ?
__label__1 along with cops , the goat is one of keaton 's two funniest shorts .
__label__1 fantastic chaplin movie with many memorable moments as charlie joins the army to fight in ww 1 .
__label__1 easily one of the best shows ever made , & it just gets better with age .
__label__1 the peoples court is definitely the best of the tv court shows .
__label__1 kirstie alley , as the child 's harried mom , comes up with a mesmerizing and utterly convincing portrayal .
__label__1 the rest of the cast is superb , especially rooney and revere .
__label__1 i am a great fan of this movie and would , and have , recommended it to all .
__label__1 it portrays true love and passion , and not just `` heat . ''
__label__1 i really liked what i had heard of this movie and wanted to watch it for a long time .
__label__1 there are so many little jokes , so many big jokes , such lovely and real touching moments .
__label__1 but it is a joy to watch on its own terms and i highly recommend it .
__label__1 this is a wonderful , funny , compassionate movie with a real heart .
__label__1 lots of singing and dancing in this one , especially by gene kelly .
__label__1 `` play it again , sam '' shows a restrained woody allen acting on his own material .
__label__1 the story is a little soapy from another time but just as worthwhile as most dramas .
__label__1 perfect acting { by all } , perfect music , perfect story .
__label__1 john hurt 's character gives his daughter , played beautifully by penelope cruz , some honest advice about love .
__label__1 quirky , vulnerable , raw , honest and a treat to watch .
__label__1 this movie is by far one of the best urban crime dramas i 've seen .
__label__1 the ghost train is a treat to those who appreciate the typical 1940 's humour .
__label__1 the second time i knew what to expect and i enjoyed it more than the first time .
__label__1 as their stories develop , and we learn about these individuals , the actual match builds with surprising tension .
__label__1 i have seen dirty work several times and is probably my favourite stan and ollie short .
__label__1 sandra bernhard is cast perfectly as the straight , self-obsessed therapist .
__label__1 if you wanted to see jim carrey before he was the grinch then this is the movie to see !
__label__1 if you 're in the mood for comedy , married to the mob is a keeper .
__label__1 compared to other movies of this genre , flood is right up there with the best of them .
__label__1 this movie blew me away and i gave it a 9 .
__label__1 a truly moving drama everybody on the planet should see this show .
__label__1 combined with great music and cinematography , the movie works like a truly poetic work of art .
__label__1 the japanese critics might be really lame but they 're much better than anything you 'll see here .
__label__1 this is one of the best italian thrillers of the early 70 's .
__label__1 this is for sure one of my favorite all time movies .
__label__1 it takes a typical and historic american tale , but adds a bit of the sayles influence .
__label__1 rain is also based not directly on the maugham prose , but on a stage version .
__label__1 the characters were so well-developed that i still find myself hooked to their trials , tribulations , and triumphs .
__label__1 this movie had just as much passion and love for the game and the characters as the other one .
__label__1 a little too stylized for some but i fancy that any opera lover will love it .
__label__1 a timeless classic , one of the best films of all time .
__label__1 but `` where the sidewalk ends '' really is a good example of what the genre is all about .
__label__1 this movie continues the tradition of clint eastwood making great movies .
__label__1 bill nighy who puts on one of the best performances i 've ever seen in a film .
__label__1 joan crawford 's performance is fierce and chilling in its complexity .
__label__1 and movie is totally backed up by the excellent music both in background and in songs by monty .
__label__1 it 's one of the all-around funniest movies i 've ever seen .
__label__1 do n't listen to the critics of this work , it 's a fantastic piece .
__label__1 low key and gentle , the film rolls out the story much as life does .
__label__1 `` hidden in silence '' is another good story of human sympathy in world war ii .
__label__1 the sexual tension between madame and neel , though enacted subtly , is nevertheless palpable .
__label__1 this has to be one of my favourite films woody has directed .
__label__1 this movie is not only the funniest film ever created , it 's the greatest .
__label__1 i have a deep love for and passion about movies like this one .
__label__1 kevin costner and whitney houston truly portrayed the couple of the year .
__label__1 not as good as arsenic and old lace , but what is ?
__label__1 i recommend for the people who disliked this movie to watch it again and give it another try .
__label__1 the bodyguard , in my opinion , is a great whitney houston movie .
__label__1 maybe a little over the top but still brilliant .
__label__1 a very very playful movie that does not dwell for a moment .
__label__1 a cute little comedy and a welcome film to the annual holiday film lineup .
__label__1 a wonderful feeling to be one of the first to see this very amusing and merry movie .
__label__1 put simply , anyone who has experienced anything like it will relate .
__label__1 since then , it 's grown on me and i 'd give it a `` 9 '' .
__label__1 so many memories that make us a part of a family most people never had .
__label__1 something nobody can fail to fully enjoy and appreciate .
__label__1 the actors are wonderful , there 's really nothing bad to say about this movie .
__label__1 a magnificent movie , above all other so called boxing movies , including rocky , etc .
__label__1 gene kelly does n't miss a step , and frank sinatra does n't miss a note .
__label__1 mickey rourke is a brilliant actor and he 's stands miles ahead all the rest .
__label__1 matthau commands the screen and there is not a false note in this beautifully timed performance .
__label__1 the film is uneven at time , and the script slightly lacking , but the performances are first rate .
__label__1 this show is easily one of the most true to life series to ever hit the air .
__label__1 stanwyck , merrill and sanders were all superb , as were the minor roles well-played .
__label__1 it 's just not right that more folks in the us have n't seen this great film .
__label__1 this was a gem that i had never heard about that graced my dvd player well .
__label__1 anyone who 's ever been to a pink floyd concert has seen it all before - and better .
__label__1 this is a very hard-to-find 'old house film ' ... .but see it if you get a chance !
__label__1 harrelson and lewis fit their roles perfectly and really convey that these two people love each other .
__label__1 we can learn a lot from this movie and we should be proud on our great treasure on earth .
__label__1 grease definitely has a fun energy to it , and all of the cast has great chemistry .
__label__1 she just seems so much more genuine than so many other talk show hosts .
__label__1 i recommend `` the dead '' without reservation as one of the finest films ever made .
__label__1 this film is very refreshing , and likely to be banned at any moment .
__label__1 all interested in foreign film & film in south america & argentina will like this film .
__label__1 if you like a myriad of emotions within a movie then i would definitely recommend this one .
